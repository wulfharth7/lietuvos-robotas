ðŸ¤– a reddit bot to inflect words in languages

I'll update the readme more when it's fully developed, but for now I'll share the screenshots of development here, this is the recent situation, works only for lithuanian now.

**the bot decides if the given word is verb, noun or adjective and creates a table according to that**
